    When Nikola can not find opponent for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominoes">Domino</a> game,
    he spread Magic Domino Solitaire.
    The goal of the solitaire is build a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square">Magic square</a> with
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominoes#Tiles_and_suits">Double Six</a> domino tiles.
</p>

<p>
    A magic square is an arrangement of distinct integers, in a square grid,
    where the numbers in each row, and in each column, and the numbers in the forward and backward main diagonals,
    all add up to the same number.<br>
    Domino tiles contains two numbers from 0 (empty) to 6. Tiles are unordered and 1-6 is the same as 6-1.
    The double-six set contains 28 unique tiles - all combinations of number pairs.

</p>
<p>
    You are given a <strong>size</strong> for the magic square and a <strong>number</strong>.
    You should build a magic square by given <strong>size</strong>
    so that the sum of the horizontal and vertical diagonals equal the given <strong>number</strong>.
    You can place domino tiles from double-six set only <strong>vertically</strong> and they should be <strong>unique</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Here is example for <strong>size</strong> = 4 and <strong>number</strong> = 5:

<p style="text-align: center;">
    <img title="square"
         src="{{MEDIA}}square.png"
         alt="square"
         width="200px"/>
</p>

<p>
    The result magic square should be represented as a list/tuple of lists/tuples with integers.
</p>


<p><strong>Input: </strong>Two arguments. A magic square size and a number as integers</p>

<p><strong>Output: </strong>The magic square as a list/tuple of lists/tuples with integers.</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre class="brush: python">checkio(4, 5) == ((0, 0, 2, 3),
                  (0, 4, 1, 0),

    <strong>How it is used:</strong>
    This is a constraint satisfaction problem.
    It's used not only for solving solitaries, but also for planning and resource allocation in city planning,
    construction and just about everywhere else.

</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong><br>
    size in (4, 6)<br>
    All input test cases are solvable.
